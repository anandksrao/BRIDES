---

These files are the genome similarity networks (70% cover, 90% similarity threshold, minimum BLAST e-value 10e-5) used to generate the results of figure 4 (Lord et al. 2016). They were generated from 2,094,593 nucleotide sequenes of archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes using the [EGN](http://www.evol-net.fr/index.php/en/downloads) software.  

BRIDES algorithm results for those network using the parameters: (MaxPathNumber=100, MaxDistance=100, MaxNode=100, please see [manual](https://github.com/etiennelord/BRIDES/blob/master/Manual/BRIDES_User_Guide.pdf) for explanations) are also provided.
